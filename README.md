# Explainable-AI-for-Heart-Rate-Variability-in-ECG-Signal
The python files provided in this folder contains the full flow of the detection of tachycardia diseases. It includes training the each model such as RNN ,LSTM, GRU, CNN nd RSCNN with the AF dataset and testing the model with different kinds of test data such as AF, VF,ST datasets. The datasets are available in Physionet(https://physionet.org/about/database/). The python files also include the cross validation codes used for the convolutional neural networks.
